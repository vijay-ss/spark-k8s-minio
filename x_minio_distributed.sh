# Run the Minio StatefulSet example on a minikube instance.
#
# For a fresh start, run the following first:
#   minikube delete
#   minikube start
#
# To upgrade minikube & kubectl on OSX, the following should suffice:
#   brew reinstall kubernetes-cli --devel
#   url -Lo minikube \
#     https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.4.0/minikube-darwin-amd64 && \
#   chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/

set -exuo pipefail

# Clean up anything from a prior run:
kubectl delete statefulsets,persistentvolumes,persistentvolumeclaims,services,poddisruptionbudget -l app=minio

# Make persistent volumes and (correctly named) claims. We must create the
# claims here manually even though that sounds counter-intuitive. For details
# see https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/pull/1295#issuecomment-230180894.
